Hi! I'm William, a software engineer hailing from Malaysia who's currently working in the fintech space in London, UK. 

I'm responsible for the credit cards services at Zopa as a senior software engineer. I'm also an aspirational distributed systems apprentice and am always interested to have a chat about distributed systems!
